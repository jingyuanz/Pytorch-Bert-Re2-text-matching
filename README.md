# Pytorch-Bert-Re2-text-matching

Simply a pytorch implementation of RE2, instead of Glove embedding, this version uses pretrained-Bert (provided by the library called transformers) to generate features as RE2 input.
Some hyper params and model details are not carefully implemented yet, and will see them in the future.
